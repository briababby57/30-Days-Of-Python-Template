# Numbers Arithmetic, and Printing to the Console
## Basic Numbers
_There is several different ways of representing numbers which is integers and floats._


Integer = 2


float = 3.14

## The 'print' function
_print is a builtin function that will output things to the console to see._
_We can use the print  function multiple times if we want to, and values get printed out in the order of our print was called_


## Arithmetic Operators 
_If you want to add two numbers you use the addition symbol +. To subtract use the minus symbol -. To divide use the / symbol & to Multiply use thw * symbol._
_So when we write 3 + 2, Python evaluates that and we get an integer with the value 5_

````python
print(1 + 2)
print(3.4 + 11)
print(8 + 4.0)
````

We can also link together different operators: they don’t all have to be + or -, etc.

````python
5 * 3 - 6 + 2 / 4
````

# Day 1 Exercises

1. Print your age, name, and year of birth to the console.

````python
print(23)
print(Bria)
print(2000)
````

2. Calculate and print the number of days, weeks, and months in 27 years. Don’t worry about leap years!

````python
print(27 * 365)
print(27 * 52)
print(27 * 12)
# 9855 days, 1404 weeks, and 324 months.
````


4. Calculate and print the area of a circle with a radius of 5 units. You can be as accurate as you like with the value of pi.
   ** can be used to square a number
   
   ````python
   print(3.141 * 5 ** 2) # 78.525
````
